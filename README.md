## A Movie For Every Mood!

## Purpose:
Ever wonder what it would be like to choose a movie depending on what type of mood you're in? Well, MoodFlix can help! Simply select a "MoodMoji" from the dropdown menu to search movies that fit your mood. Once your MoodFlix upload to the page, you can hover over the images to reveal the movie title, genre, short description and rating. And if you're looking for a fun quote to share with your friends, click the "New Quote" button at the bottom of the page to view random quotes from popular movies and series.
